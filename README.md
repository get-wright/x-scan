# X-Scan Toolset

This project provides a containerized security scanning pipeline that runs multiple security analysis tools against your codebase.

- **Trivy**: Vulnerability and misconfiguration scanning
- **Checkov**: Infrastructure-as-Code security scanning

Configure the scanning environment in the .env

```env
SEMGREP_TOKEN=<your-semgrep-token>
SCAN_PATH=<path-to-code-to-scan>

TRIVY_SEVERITY=HIGH,CRITICAL
TRIVY_SCANNERS=vuln,misconfig,secret
```
